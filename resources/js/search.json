This is the price point where a position gets liquidated on an exchange if the trade moves against their plan. In such a scenario a trade is closed automatically by market order (or gradually deleveraged when coming close to the price) by the exchange to prevent losses for the exchange and higher losses for the trader. This price point can be approximately visualized on the liquidation heatmap from Liquidity Hunts."]}],[{"l":"Liquidation heatmaps explained","p":["A liquidation heatmap (figure 1) is a visual representation of the liquidation levels of traders in a market. It is calculated using market data and different leverage amounts. The liquidation levels are then added to price buckets on a chart. The more liquidation levels are added to a certain price, the brighter the color of the heatmap becomes, with bright yellow representing the highest amount of predicted liquidation levels. This allows traders to identify areas of high liquidity and potential price volatility.","In other words, a liquidation heatmap is a tool that helps traders identify where other traders are most likely to be liquidated. This can be useful for both long and short traders, as it can help them to avoid being liquidated themselves and to identify potential trading opportunities.","Price is likely to move towards a brighter zone of liquidations. If the liquidation zone is above the price as in figure 1 (see below) traders can expect the price to go towards that zone and could look for a long and take profit at that zone. Shorters could look at the liquidation zone and choose to take a short. In figure 2 it is visible that price immediately reversed after the liquidity was taken at the bright yellow zone.","Figure 1: 7-Day heatmap of TIAUSD. There is a bright yellow liquidation zone above the latest spike. Price could move towards that price to liquidate shorters.","Figure 2: Price completely reversed after hitting the bright yellow liquidation zone thus presenting a perfect entry for a short trade or an exit for a previous long trade.","We also have heatmaps for stocks like SP500, Google, Nvidia, Tesla and Amazon. In the video below you can find an example of the SP500 heatmaps at 3:33."]}],[{"l":"Heatmaps usage","p":["Heatmaps can be used for","More profitable (scalp)trades","Better exits / take profit","Better entries","Better trading profit","A better placement of the stop loss: e.g. above or below the liquidation zones"]}],[{"l":"Heatmap support","p":["Currently Liquidity Hunts supports Binance Futures cryptocurrencies and the top 100 coins if listed on Binance.

It can occur in any market, but it is most common in volatile markets with low liquidity.","There are a few reasons why slippage can occur, including market volatility, low liquidity, and the type of order placed.","Slippage can be costly for traders, but there are a few things you can do to reduce the risk, such as avoiding trading during volatile market conditions, trading in liquid markets, using limit orders instead of market orders, and being aware of the bid-ask spread.","Overall, slippage is a normal part of trading, but it is important to be aware of it and take steps to minimize its impact on your profits."]}],[{"l":"Slippage indicator usage","p":["The Slippage Indicator can be used to identify temporary tops and bottoms. This information can be used to start a new trade, be it long or short.","In figure 1 (below) you can see that the slippage indicator produces some big bars and the price candlesticks have quite a few wicks. This indicates that liquidy is low and that there could be a possible bottom. This information can be combined with other indicators like a low RSI and support zone to start a long trade. Conversely, if this happens at the top you could look for a short."]}],[{"l":"Faqs"}]]
