# Slippage indicator

Slippage in trading is the difference between the expected price of a trade and the actual price at which the trade is executed. It can occur in any market, but it is most common in volatile markets with low liquidity.

There are a few reasons why slippage can occur, including market volatility, low liquidity, and the type of order placed.

Slippage can be costly for traders, but there are a few things you can do to reduce the risk, such as avoiding trading during volatile market conditions, trading in liquid markets, using limit orders instead of market orders, and being aware of the bid-ask spread.

Overall, slippage is a normal part of trading, but it is important to be aware of it and take steps to minimize its impact on your profits.
