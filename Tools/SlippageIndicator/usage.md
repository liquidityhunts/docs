# Slippage indicator usage
The Slippage Indicator can be used to identify temporary tops and bottoms. This information can be used to start a new trade, be it long or short. 

In figure 1 (below) you can see that the slippage indicator produces some big bars and the price candlesticks have quite a few wicks. This indicates that liquidy is low and that there could be a possible bottom. This information can be combined with other indicators like a low RSI and support zone to start a long trade. Conversely, if this happens at the top you could look for a short.
