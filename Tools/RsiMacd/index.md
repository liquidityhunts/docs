# RSI and MACD alerts

RSI and MACD are well known indicators in trading that can be used to make a trade plan. Liquidity Hunts provides a table for RSI making it easy to find which RSI’s are oversold or overbought in a glance (figure 1).

We have also built an alert system for RSI values and MACD crossings for different timeframes. Let’s say you are daytrading and are looking for a scalptrade. You click the 5M(inute) timeframe and you can see which crypto’s are oversold or overbought for a trade. If you are more into swing trading you can use a 4H MACD crossing with the alert system.
